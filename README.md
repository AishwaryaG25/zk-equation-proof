ZK Implementation Challenge
● Section 1: Problem Definition
○ Given a specific equation, x^2 + x + 7, the prover wants to prove to the verifier that
he knows a value of x, such that the equation resolves to 9, but without revealing the
value of x.
○ Write down all the sets of public and private inputs of the circuit.
● Section 2: ZK Protocol Selection
○ Choose a suitable ZK protocol (e.g., Plonk, Groth16, or Stark) for the given problem.
○ Justify your choice based on factors like efficiency, security, and ease of
implementation.
● Section 3: Circuit Design
○ Design a ZK circuit to represent the computation or verification process.
○ Break down the circuit into smaller arithmetic circuits or lookup arguments.
○ Optimize the circuit for efficiency and minimize proof size.
● Section 4: Implementation
○ Implement the ZK circuit using a ZK framework like Circom or Noir.
○ Generate ZK proofs and verify them using the appropriate verifier.
○ Consider the trade-offs between proof generation time, proof size, and verification
time
